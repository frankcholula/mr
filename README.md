# Medical Robotics ü§ñ
Hello! This is an assignment repository for the University of Surrey's Medical Robotics class. You'll find kinematics simulation and workspace analysis for a 4-DOF PincherX 100 robot arm in this repository. I've built the simulations using [Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox in Python](https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-python). The write-up can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/frankcholula/Medical-Robotics-Coursework-1403b40fbcd580b9b51ddbc292d31d40?pvs=4) on my personal Notion page.
